      <div class="content-area">
        <p>To ensure every Canadian succeeds in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we must grow our economy to be more
          innovative and productive. One where every Canadian can reach their full potential, where every entrepreneur
          has the tools they need to grow their business, and where hard work pays off. Building the economy of the
          future is about creating jobs: jobs in the knowledge economy, jobs in manufacturing, jobs in mining and
          forestry, jobs in the trades, jobs in clean energy, and jobs across the economy, in all regions of the
          country.</p>
        <p>To do this, the government's economic plan is investing in the technologies, incentives, and supports
          critical to increasing productivity, fostering innovation, and attracting more private investment to Canada.
          This is how we'll build an economy that unlocks new pathways for every generation to earn their fair share.
        </p>
        <p>The government is targeting investments to make sure Canada continues to lead in the economy of the future,
          and these are already generating stronger growth and meaningful new job opportunities for Canadians. New
          jobs—from construction to manufacturing to engineering—in clean technology, in clean energy, and in
          innovation, are just the start. All of this, helping to attract further investment to create more
          opportunities, will raise Canada's productivity and competitiveness. This will create more good jobs, and in
          turn, raise the living standards of all Canadians. </p>
        <p>We are at a pivotal moment where we can choose to renew and redouble our investments in the economy of the
          future, to build an economy that is more productive and more competitive—or risk leaving an entire generation
          behind. We will not make that mistake. We owe it to our businesses, to our innovators, and most of all, to the
          upcoming generations of workers, to make sure that the Canadian economy is positioned to thrive in a changing
          world.</p>
        <p>Canada has the best-educated workforce in the world. We are making investments to ensure every generation of
          workers has the skills the job market, and the global economy, are looking for—and this will help us attract
          private investment to grow the economy (Chart 4.1). Building on our talented workforce, we are delivering, on
          a priority basis, our $93&nbsp;billion suite of major economic investment tax credits to drive growth, secure
          the future of Canadian businesses in Canada, and create good jobs for generations to come.</p>
        <p>In the first three quarters of&nbsp;2023, Canada had the highest level of foreign direct investment (FDI) on
          a per capita basis among G7 countries, and ranked third globally in total FDI, after the U.S. and Brazil
          (Chart 4.2). </p>

        <p>Canada's artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem is among the best in the world. Since&nbsp;2017, the
          government has invested over $2 billion towards AI in Canada. Fuelled by those investments, Canada is globally
          recognized for strong AI talent, research, and its AI&nbsp;sector. </p>
        <p>Today, Canada's AI sector is ranked first in the world for growth of women in AI, and first in the G7 for
          year-over-year growth of AI talent. Every year since&nbsp;2019, Canada has published the most AI-related
          papers, per capita, in the G7. Our AI firms are filing patents at three times the average rate in the G7, and
          they are attracting nearly a third of all venture capital in Canada. In&nbsp;2022-23, there were over 140,000
          actively engaged AI professionals in Canada, an increase of&nbsp;29&nbsp;per cent compared to the previous
          year. These are just a few of Canada's competitive advantages in AI and we are aiming even higher. </p>

        <p>AI is a transformative economic opportunity for Canada and the government is committed to doing more to
          support our world-class research community, launch Canadian AI businesses, and help them scale-up to meet the
          demands of the global economy. The processing capacity required by AI is accelerating a global push for the
          latest technology, for the latest computing infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Currently, most compute capacity is located in other countries. Challenges accessing compute power slows down
          AI research and innovation, and also exposes Canadian firms to a reliance on privately-owned computing,
          outside of Canada. This comes with dependencies and security risks. And, it is a barrier holding back our AI
          firms and researchers.</p>
        <p>We need to break those barriers to stay competitive in the global AI race and ensure workers benefit from the
          higher wages of AI transformations; we must secure Canada's AI advantage. We also need to ensure workers who
          fear their jobs may be negatively impacted by AI have the tools and skills training needed in a changing
          economy. </p>

          funding for the federal granting councils—the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the
          Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council
          (SSHRC). </p>
        <p>This research support enables groundbreaking discoveries in areas such as climate change, health emergencies,
          artificial intelligence, and psychological health. This plays a critical role in solving the world's greatest
          challenges, those that will have impacts for generations. </p>
        <p>Canada's granting councils already do excellent work within their areas of expertise, but more needs to be
          done to maximize their effect. The improvements we are making today, following extensive consultations
          including with the Advisory Panel on the Federal Research Support System, will strengthen and modernize
          Canada's federal research support. </p>

        <h3 id="a11">Investing in Homegrown Research Talent</h3>
        <p>Canada's student and postgraduate researchers are tackling some of the world's biggest challenges. The
          solutions they come up with have the potential to make the world a better place and drive Canadian prosperity.
          They are the future Canadian academic and scientific excellence, who will create new innovative businesses,
          develop new ways to boost productivity, and create jobs as they scale-up companies—if they get the support
          they need. </p>
        <p>To build a world-leading, innovative economy, and improve our productive capacity, the hard work of top
          talent must pay off; we must incentivize our top talent to stay here. </p>
        <p>Federal support for master's, doctoral, and post-doctoral students and fellows has created new research
          opportunities for the next generation of scientific talent. Opportunities to conduct world-leading research
          are critical for growing our economy. In the knowledge economy, the global market for these ideas is highly
          competitive and we need to make sure talented people have the right incentives to do their groundbreaking
          research here in Canada.</p>

        <p>In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, a competitive economy is a clean economy. There is no greater proof than the
          $2.4 trillion worth of investment made around the world, last year, in net-zero economies. Canada is at the
          forefront of the global race to attract investment and seize the opportunities of the clean economy, with the
          government announcing a net-zero economic plan that will invest over $160&nbsp;billion. This includes an
          unprecedented suite of major economic investment tax credits, which will help attract investment through
          $93&nbsp;billion in incentives by 2034-35.</p>
        <p>All told, the government's investments will crowd in more private investment, securing Canadian leadership in
          clean electricity and innovation, creating economic growth and more good-paying jobs across the country.</p>
        <p>Investors at home and around the world are taking notice of Canada's plan. In defiance of global economic
          headwinds, last year public markets and private equity capital flows into Canada's net-zero economy
          grew—reaching $14&nbsp;billion in&nbsp;2023, according to RBC. Proof that Canada's investments are
          working—driving new businesses to take shape, creating good jobs, and making sure that we have clean air and
          clean water for our kids, grandkids, and for generations to come. </p>

        <p>This first place ranking of Canada's EV supply chains is underpinned by our abundant clean energy, high
          labour standards, and rigorous standards for consultation and engagement with Indigenous communities. That's
          what Canada's major economic investment tax credits are doing—seizing Canada's full potential, and doing it
          right.</p>
        <p>By 2050, clean energy GDP could grow fivefold—up to $500&nbsp;billion, while keeping Canada on track to reach
          net-zero by 2050. Proof, once again, that good climate policy is good economic policy.</p>

        <p>Helping innovative Canadian firms scale-up is essential to increasing the pace of economic growth in Canada.
          Already, the Cleantech Group's 2023 list of the 100 most innovative global clean technology companies featured
          12 Canadian companies, the second highest number of any country, behind only the U.S. The government is
          investing in clean technology companies to ensure their full capabilities are unlocked. </p>
        <p>Budget&nbsp;2024 announces the next steps in the government's plan to attract even more investment to Canada
          to create good-paying jobs and accelerate the development and deployment of clean energy and clean technology.

        <h3 id="a18">A New EV Supply Chain Investment Tax Credit</h3>
        <p>The automotive industry is undergoing a major transformation. As more and more electric vehicles are being
          produced worldwide, it is essential that Canada's automotive industry has the support it needs to retool its
          assembly lines and build new factories to seize the opportunities of the global switch to electric vehicles.
          With our world-class natural resource base, talented workforce, and attractive investment climate, Canada will
          be an electric vehicle supply chain hub for all steps along the manufacturing process. This is an opportunity
          for Canada to secure its position today at the forefront of this growing global supply chain and secure
          high-quality jobs for Canadian workers for a generation to come.</p>
        <p>Businesses that manufacture electric vehicles and their precursors would already be able to claim the
          30&nbsp;per cent Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit on the cost of their investments in new
          machinery and equipment, as announced in Budget&nbsp;2023. Providing additional support to these businesses so
          they choose Canada for more than one stage in the manufacturing process would secure more jobs for Canadians
          and help cement Canada's position as a leader in this sector.</p>

            <div class="media-body">Budget&nbsp;2024 announces the government's intention to introduce a new 10&nbsp;per
              cent Electric Vehicle Supply Chain investment tax credit on the cost of buildings used in key segments of
              the electric vehicle supply chain, for businesses that invest in Canada across three supply chain
              segments:
              <ul>
                <li>electric vehicle assembly;</li>

              </ul>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>For a taxpayer's building costs in any of the specified segments to qualify for the tax credit, the taxpayer
          (or a member of a group of related taxpayers) must claim the Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax
          credit in all three of the specified segments, or two of the three specified segments and hold at least a
          qualifying minority interest in an unrelated corporation that claims the Clean Technology Manufacturing tax
          credit in the third segment. The building costs of the unrelated corporation would also qualify for the new
          investment tax credit.</p>
        <p>The EV Supply Chain investment tax credit would apply to property that is acquired and becomes available for
          use on or after January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2024. The credit would be reduced to&nbsp;5&nbsp;per cent for&nbsp;2033
          and 2034, and would no longer be in effect after 2034.</p>
        <p>The EV Supply Chain investment tax credit is expected to cost $80&nbsp;million over five years, starting
          in&nbsp;2024-25, and an additional $1.02&nbsp;billion from&nbsp;2029-30 to&nbsp;2034-35.</p>
        <p>The design and implementation details of the EV Supply Chain investment tax credit will be provided in the
          <em>2024 Fall Economic Statement</em>. Its design would incorporate elements of the Clean Technology
          Manufacturing investment tax credit, where applicable.</p>
        <h3 id="a19">Delivering Major Economic Investment Tax Credits</h3>
        <p>To seize the investment opportunities of the global clean economy, we are delivering our six major economic
          investment tax credits. These will provide businesses and other investors with the certainty they need to
          invest and build in Canada. And they are already attracting major, job-creating projects, ensuring we remain
          globally competitive.</p>
        <p>From new clean electricity projects that will provide clean and affordable energy to Canadian homes and
          businesses, to carbon capture projects that will decarbonize heavy industry, our major economic investment tax
          credits are moving Canada forward on its track to achieve a net-zero economy by 2050.</p>
        <p>In November&nbsp;2023, the government introduced Bill C-59 to deliver the first two investment tax credits
          and provide businesses with the certainty they need to make investment decisions in Canada today. Bill C-59
          also includes labour requirements to ensure workers are paid prevailing union wages and apprentices have
          opportunities to gain experience and succeed in the workforce. With the support and collaboration of
          Parliamentarians, the government anticipates Bill C-59 receiving Royal Assent before June&nbsp;1, 2024.</p>

            Budget&nbsp;2024, for projects that did not begin construction before March&nbsp;28, 2023;</li>
          <li>Expanding Eligibility for the Clean Technology and Clean Electricity investment tax credits to support
            using waste biomass to generate heat and electricity:
            <ul>
              <li>The expansion of the Clean Technology investment tax credit would be available as of November 21,
                2023; and,</li>
              <li>The expansion of the Clean Electricity investment tax credit would be available from the day of
                Budget&nbsp;2024, for projects that did not begin construction before March&nbsp;28,
                2023.<strong></strong></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit</strong> enhancements to provide new clarity
            and improve access for critical minerals projects. Draft legislation will be released for consultation in
            summer 2024 and the government targets introducing legislation in fall 2024. </li>
          <li><strong>The EV Supply Chain investment tax credit</strong>: would be available as of January 1, 2024.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given that the major economic investment tax credits will be available, including retroactively, from their
          respective coming into force dates, businesses are already taking action to break ground on projects that will
          reduce emissions, create jobs, and grow the economy. Passing the major economic investment tax credits into
          law will secure a cleaner, more prosperous future for Canadians today, and tomorrow.</p>

        <p>As the economy grows, Canada's electricity demand is expected to double by 2050 (Chart 4.7). To meet this
          increased demand with a clean, reliable, and affordable grid, our electricity capacity must increase by 1.7
          to&nbsp;2.2&nbsp;times compared to current levels (Chart 4.8). Investing in clean electricity today will
          reduce Canadians' monthly energy costs by 12&nbsp;per cent (Chart 4.9) and create approximately 250,000 good
          jobs by 2050 (Chart 4.10).</p>

        <p>Canada already has one of the cleanest electricity grids in the world, with 84&nbsp;per cent of electricity
          produced by non-emitting sources of generation. Quebec, British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador,
          and Yukon are already clean electricity leaders and generate nearly all of their electricity from non-emitting
          hydropower—and have more untapped clean electricity potential. Other regions of Canada will require major
          investments to ensure clean, reliable electricity grids, and the federal government is stepping up to support
          provinces and territories with these investments.</p>
        <p>In Budget&nbsp;2023, the government announced the new Clean Electricity investment tax credit to deliver
          broad-based support to implement clean electricity technologies and accelerate progress towards a Canada-wide
          net-zero electricity grid.</p>

            <div class="media-body">Budget&nbsp;2024 announces the design and implementation details of the Clean
              Electricity investment tax credit with the following design features:
              <ul>
                <li>A 15&nbsp;per cent refundable tax credit rate for eligible investments in new equipment or
                  refurbishments related to:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Low-emitting electricity generation systems using energy from wind, solar, water, geothermal,
                      waste biomass, nuclear, or natural gas with carbon capture and storage. </li>
                    <li>Stationary electricity storage systems that do not use fossil fuels in operation, such as
                      batteries and pumped hydroelectric storage.</li>
                    <li>Transmission of electricity between provinces and territories.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The Clean Electricity investment tax credit would be available to certain taxable and non-taxable
                  corporations, including corporations owned by municipalities or Indigenous communities, and pension
                  investment corporations. </li>
                <li>Provided that a provincial and territorial government satisfies additional conditions, outlined
                  below, the tax credit would also be available to provincial and territorial Crown corporations
                  investing in that province or territory.</li>
                <li>Robust labour requirements to pay prevailing union wages and create apprenticeship opportunities
                  will need to be met to receive the full 15&nbsp;per cent tax credit. </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Clean Electricity investment tax credit is expected to cost $7.2&nbsp;billion over five years starting
          in&nbsp;2024-25, and an additional $25&nbsp;billion from&nbsp;2029-30 to&nbsp;2034-35.</p>
        <p>The Clean Electricity investment tax credit would apply to property that is acquired and becomes available
          for use on or after the day of Budget&nbsp;2024 for projects that did not begin construction before
          March&nbsp;28, 2023. The credit would no longer be in effect after 2034. Similar rules would apply for
          provincial and territorial Crown corporations, with modifications outlined below.</p>
        <h4 id="a21">Provincial and Territorial Crown Corporations</h4>
        <p>The federal government is proposing that, for provincial and territorial Crown corporations to access to the
          Clean Electricity investment tax credit within a jurisdiction, the government of that province or territory
          would need to: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Publicly commit to:
            <ol>
              <li>Work towards a net-zero electricity grid by 2035; and,</li>
              <li>Provincial and territorial Crown corporations passing through the value of the Clean Electricity
                investment tax credit to electricity ratepayers in their province or territory to reduce ratepayers'
                bills.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Direct provincial and territorial Crown corporations claiming the credit to publicly report, on an annual
            basis, on how the tax credit has improved ratepayers' bills. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a provincial or territorial government satisfies all the conditions by March&nbsp;31, 2025, then
          provincial or territorial Crown corporations investing in that jurisdiction would be able to access the Clean
          Electricity investment tax credit for property that is acquired and becomes available for use on or after the
          day of Budget&nbsp;2024 for projects that did not begin construction before March&nbsp;28, 2023.</p>
        <p>If a provincial or territorial government does not satisfy all the conditions by March&nbsp;31, 2025, then
          provincial or territorial Crown corporations investing in that jurisdiction would not be able to access the
          Clean Electricity investment tax credit until all the conditions have been satisfied. In this case, the Clean
          Electricity investment tax credit would apply to property that is acquired and becomes available for use from
          the date when the conditions are deemed to have been satisfied for projects that did not begin construction
          before March&nbsp;28, 2023.</p>
        <p>The Department of Finance Canada will consult with provinces and territories on the details of these
          conditions before legislation is introduced this fall. </p>
        <p>Additional design and implementation details for the tax credit can be found in the Budget Tax Measures
          Supplementary Information, under "Clean Electricity investment tax credit."</p>

        <h3 id="a23">The Canada Growth Fund</h3>
        <p>The Canada Growth Fund is a $15&nbsp;billion arm's length public investment vehicle launched by the federal
          government to attract private capital and invest in Canadian projects and businesses, which is led by Canada's
          world-leading public sector pension professionals. The Canada Growth Fund investments in clean energy and
          clean technology are already building Canada's strong, clean economy and creating good-paying jobs across the
          country:<strong> </strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>On October&nbsp;25, 2023, the Canada Growth Fund made its first investment—a $90&nbsp;million investment
            in a groundbreaking geothermal energy company, Calgary's Eavor Technologies Inc., that is creating
            meaningful employment opportunities for Albertans and securing the Canadian future of a company at the
            leading-edge of the global economy.&nbsp; </li>
          <li>The Canada Growth Fund's second investment was announced on December&nbsp;20, 2023—a $200&nbsp;million
            direct investment, plus complementary carbon contract offtake agreement, in a world-leading carbon capture
            and sequestration company, Calgary's Entropy Inc. to support the reduction of up to one million tonnes of
            carbon per year. This major investment will support 1,200 good jobs for Albertans and grow the company's
            Canadian-based activities.</li>
          <li>The Canada Growth Fund's third investment was announced on March&nbsp;25, 2024—a $50&nbsp;million
            commitment into the Idealist Climate Impact Fund, a clean tech investment fund led by the Montréal-based
            Idealist Capital. The clean tech fund will manage equity investments into innovative entrepreneurs and
            businesses that are creating good-paying jobs and accelerating the energy transition. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="a24">Carbon Contracts for Difference</h4>
        <p>A price on pollution is the foundation of Canada's plan to build a prosperous net-zero economy. It is a
          system that is fair and that promotes market-driven solutions. The government recognizes the substantial
          demand from industry and other stakeholders for carbon contracts for difference (CCFDs) as a tool to
          accelerate investment in decarbonization and clean growth technologies by providing certainty around carbon
          pricing.</p>
        <p>The <em>2023</em> <em>Fall Economic Statement</em> announced that the Canada Growth Fund will be the
          principal federal entity to issue CCFDs, including allocating, on a priority basis, up to $7&nbsp;billion to
          issue all forms of contracts for difference and offtake agreements. The Canada Growth Fund is fulfilling this
          important role as a federal issuer of CCFDs. Building on its initial success, the Canada Growth Fund is
          assessing the opportunity to expand its carbon contract offerings and is developing approaches that can best
          serve the different carbon credit markets across Canada:</p>
        <ul class="media-list lst-spcd mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">
          <li class="media">

            <div class="media-body">Budget&nbsp;2024 announces that the Canada Growth Fund is developing an expanded
              range of CCFD offerings tailored to different markets and their unique risks and opportunities. The Canada
              Growth Fund will continue offering bespoke CCFDs and carbon offtake agreements, with a focus on provinces
              contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions reductions.</div>

            <div class="media-body">Building on the insights gained from these transactions, Budget&nbsp;2024 announces
              the Canada Growth Fund will explore ways to broaden its approach, for example, by developing off-the-shelf
              contracts for certain jurisdictions and ways to offer these contracts on a competitive basis for a set
              amount of emissions reductions.</div>
          </li>
          <li class="media">
            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-circle-arrow-right media-object pull-left mrgn-tp-sm"></span>
            <div class="media-body">The Canada Growth Fund has around $6&nbsp;billion remaining to continue issuing, on
              a priority basis, all forms of CCFDs and carbon offtake agreements. Budget&nbsp;2024 announces the
              government will ensure that the Canada Growth Fund continues to have the resources it needs to fulfill its
              role as federal issuer of CCFDs. The government is also evaluating options to enhance the Canada Growth
              Fund's capacity to offer CCFDs, including by exploring the possibility of a government backstop of certain
              CCFD liabilities of the Canada Growth Fund.</div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>CCFDs can help develop robust carbon credit markets, and the federal government has taken action to ensure
          their success. For example, in&nbsp;2022, Environment and Climate Change Canada worked with Alberta to ensure
          that their TIER market was sufficiently stringent so that the projected demand for carbon credits exceeded
          projected supply, ensuring robust credit demand even as more major decarbonization projects get built and more
          credits are generated. </p>
        <p>Credit markets are largely the responsibility of provinces, and there are opportunities to improve how these
          markets function. For example, commitments to maintain their industrial carbon pricing systems over the
          long-term, tighten the stringency of systems as necessary to avoid an oversupply of credits, publishing the
          price of carbon credits, and recommitting to maintain a price signal of $170&nbsp;per tonne by 2030 could help
          improve carbon price expectations for investors. Increased credit price transparency would greatly improve
          market functioning and provide greater investment certainty, unlocking more decarbonization projects. It would
          also facilitate the Canada Growth Fund's efforts to develop off-the-shelf CCFDs and deliver more deals, much
          quicker across provincial carbon&nbsp;markets. </p>

        <h3 id="a25">Getting Major Projects Done</h3>
        <p>Putting Canada on a path to net-zero requires significant and sustained private sector investment in clean
          electricity, critical minerals, and other major projects. For these investments to be made, Canada's
          regulatory system must be efficient and quicker—it shouldn't take over a decade to open a new mine and secure
          our critical minerals supply chains. </p>
        <p>To that end, Budget&nbsp;2023 announced an intention to develop a plan to improve the efficiency of the
          impact assessment and permitting processes for major projects. The Ministerial Working Group on Regulatory
          Efficiency for Clean Growth Projects was launched to coordinate this work, and drive positive, pro-growth
          culture change throughout government, to ensure major project approvals come quicker. New major projects
          create thousands of new, good-paying jobs for Canadians, and the government is focused on getting
          more&nbsp;done.</p>

                  low-risk impacts, ensuring new permitting timelines are upheld throughout departments, and improving
                  data sharing between departments to reduce redundant studies.</li>
                <li><strong>Launch work to establish a new Federal Permitting Coordinator</strong> within the Privy
                  Council Office's Clean Growth Office. </li>

        <p>Biofuels and biogas are renewable energy sources sustainably made from plants or biowaste, such as canola
          crops and landfill emissions. Not only do they generate fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil
          fuels, they also represent a unique opportunity for the Canadian economy. The industry supports agriculture
          and forestry jobs and can help decarbonize key sectors like marine, aviation, rail, and heavy industry.
          Canada's <em>Clean Fuel Regulations</em>, in place since&nbsp;2022, are helping drive the production and
          adoption of specific biofuels in Canada. </p>

            <h4 class="panel-title mrgn-tp-0 h4" id="a29">Canada-U.S. Energy Transformation Task Force </h4>
          </header>
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p>On March&nbsp;24, 2023, the Canada-U.S. Energy Transformation Task Force was launched by Prime Minister
              Trudeau and President Biden, as a one-year joint initiative to support our collective energy security and
              economic growth as we transition to a clean energy future. Canada is pleased to announce the renewal of
              the Energy Transformation Task Force for an additional year.</p>
            <p>Since its creation, the Energy Transformation Task Force has driven significant progress towards more
              secure and resilient Canada-U.S. supply chains for critical minerals, nuclear fuels, and green steel and
              aluminum. </p>
            <p>Canada is a global leader in the supply of responsibly sourced critical minerals. The government is
              investing $3.8&nbsp;billion through the Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy to further develop Canadian
              value chains for critical minerals needed for our green and digital economy, including the new Critical
              Mineral Exploration Tax Credit. The Strategy will be further enabled by enhancements to the Clean
              Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit, and Canada's new Electric Vehicle Supply Chain investment
              tax credit. </p>
            <p>Canada is building on our strong partnership with the U.S. on critical minerals, underpinned by the
              Canada-U.S. Joint Action Plan on Critical Minerals Collaboration. Under the Energy Transformation Task
              Force, we have redoubled efforts to address issues of mutual concern such as bolstering supply security
              for critical minerals. Our government will continue to work in close collaboration with industry partners
              and our allies to support cross-border priority critical mineral projects that advance our shared
              interests. </p>
            <p>Nuclear energy will play a key role in achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Canada is a Tier-1
              nuclear nation with over 70&nbsp;years of technological leadership, including our own national reactor
              technology, and a strong domestic supply chain that includes the world's largest deposit of high-grade
              natural uranium. Our government is taking action to support the growth of nuclear energy, including
              through the Clean Electricity investment tax credit, the Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax
              credit, the Strategic Innovation Fund, the Canada Infrastructure Bank, and an updated Green Bond Framework
              that includes certain nuclear expenditures. </p>
            <p>At COP28, the government and likeminded partners reaffirmed their commitment to triple nuclear energy
              capacity and promote public-private investment to strengthen supply chains and reduce reliance on
              non-allied countries for nuclear fuel needed for advanced and conventional nuclear energy. Through the
              Energy Transformation Task Force, Canada will continue to engage industry and international partners with
              a view to announcing concrete measures later this spring to bolster North American nuclear fuel supply
              chains. </p>
            <p>Canadian steel and aluminum—among the greenest in the world—are important pillars of integrated North
              American manufacturing supply chains and key products to support the net-zero transition. We have invested
              significantly to further decarbonize our steel and aluminum sectors and to maintain their competitiveness
              in the green economy. As well, earlier this year, our government announced actions to increase the
              transparency of steel import data that will help provide more details on the origins of imported steel and
              align our practice with the U.S. We will continue to collaborate with the U.S. to promote common
              approaches for trade in low emissions green steel and aluminum goods. </p>
            <p>Canada will continue to advance its work in partnership with the U.S., to reduce our shared exposure to
              production and supply chains controlled by non-likeminded countries, including by attracting investment in
              EV supply chains, solar, and more. </p>

          confidence and mobilizing the private investment that Canada needs to help achieve a net-zero by 2050 economy.
        </p>
        <p>As announced in the <em>2023 Fall Economic Statement,</em> the Department of Finance Canada is working with
          Environment and Climate Change Canada and Natural Resources Canada to undertake next steps, in consultation
          with regulatory agencies, the financial sector, industry, and independent experts, to develop a taxonomy that
          is aligned with reaching net-zero by 2050.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>This work is being informed by the Sustainable Finance Action Council's Taxonomy Roadmap Report, which
          provided the government with recommendations on the design of a taxonomy to identify economic activities that
          the financial sector could label as "green" or "transition."&nbsp; The government will provide an update on
          the development of a Canadian taxonomy later this&nbsp;year. </p>

        <p>Small- and medium-sized businesses are an integral engine of Canada's economy, and they employ about
          64&nbsp;per cent of Canadian workers. Entrepreneurs, local small business, start-ups, growing medium-sized
          businesses—everywhere in Canada, there are people with good ideas, ready to grow their businesses and create
          good jobs. The government is ensuring Canada's investment climate sets businesses up for success.</p>
        <p>For economic growth to reach the pace that is needed, existing businesses need support to stay competitive
          and scale-up. The government is taking action to help businesses scale-up their technological innovations, and
          implement productivity-raising technology across the economy. By cutting red tape, new and existing businesses
          can grow faster. Boosting access to financing from financial Crown corporations and encouraging Canada's large
          public pension funds to put their investments to work here at home will unlock new growth opportunities for
          Canadian businesses.</p>
        <p>Through Budget&nbsp;2024, the government is making it easier for new businesses to start-up and for existing
          businesses to grow by cutting red tape, and providing the tools businesses need to scale-up. The government is
          also taking steps to have Canadian public institutions and Crown corporations put their capital to work here
          at home and seize opportunities to increase Canada's growth and productivity.</p>
        <h3 id="a34">Key Ongoing Actions</h3>

        <h3 id="a35">National Regulatory Alignment</h3>
        <p>Barriers to internal trade are preventing Canada from reaching its economic potential. These barriers, most
          commonly the 13 different sets of regulations for each province and territory, hold back businesses from
          trading across provincial and territorial borders, restrict workers from moving between provinces and
          territories, and can increase costs for businesses as they work to overcome regulatory hurdles.</p>
        <p>By addressing barriers to internal trade, including harmonizing regulations between provinces and
          territories, we can create more opportunities for Canadian businesses to grow and make life more affordable
          for all Canadians through greater competition and consumer choice. According to the International Monetary
          Fund, Canada could increase its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita by as much as 4&nbsp;per cent—or
          $2,900&nbsp;per capita estimated in&nbsp;2023 dollars through the reduction of internal trade barriers for
          interprovincial trade of goods.</p>
        <p>In&nbsp;2022, the federal government launched the <em>Federal Action Plan to Strengthen Internal Trade</em>,
          which is guiding work with the provinces and territories to cut red tape. This includes a rigorous assessment
          of remaining federal exceptions in the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) and important investments in trade
          data and research. </p>
        <p>Two significant milestones have now been reached, with further actions upcoming in&nbsp;2024: </p>
        <ul class="media-list lst-spcd mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">

              This means the removal of&nbsp;14 exceptions related to procurement that will provide Canadian businesses
              more opportunities to compete to deliver government goods and services. By the end of&nbsp;2024, the
              federal government will publicly release the rationale for all remaining exceptions, and encourages
              provinces and territories to do the same.</div>

        <h3 id="a36">The New Canada Carbon Rebate for Small Businesses</h3>
        <p>Canada's small- and medium-sized businesses keep main streets flourishing across the country, create jobs,
          and deliver the dream of entrepreneurship. It is essential that these businesses thrive so they can continue
          being the bedrock of our communities and our economy.</p>
        <p>Pollution has a cost, one which will only rise this century as climate change causes intensifying natural
          disasters and more severe health effects, as detailed in Chapter&nbsp;5. Canada's carbon pricing system
          includes a federal backstop for provinces and territories that don't put their own system in place. It's a
          system designed to be fair and affordable—for households, Indigenous communities, farmers, and
          businesses—while reducing the pollution that is causing climate change.</p>
        <p>The government is delivering on its commitment to return proceeds from the price on pollution to small- and
          medium-sized businesses, by announcing an accelerated and automated return process to provide direct refunds
          to small- and medium-sized businesses in the provinces where the federal fuel charge applies—the new Canada

              tax credit. This would deliver over $2.5 billion directly to Canada's small- and medium-sized businesses.
              <ul>
                <li>Proceeds would be returned directly to eligible corporations through direct payments from the Canada

        <p>Canada's financial Crown corporations support economic growth by helping businesses get the financing they
          need to grow; helping farmers and agri-businesses invest in new equipment and technology and support their
          operations; and helping companies sell their products around the world. </p>
        <p>Canadians expect the government to make the most of their tax dollars. That is why in the <em>2023 Fall
            Economic Statement</em> the government announced it would be reviewing the operations of the Business
          Development Bank of Canada, Export Development Canada, and Farm Credit Canada. Based on this review:</p>

            <div class="media-body">Budget&nbsp;2024 announces changes to the <em>Capital and Dividend Policy Framework

              <ul>
                <li>The amended Framework has also introduced a target solvency rating for financial Crown corporations

            <div class="media-body">Budget&nbsp;2024 announces new guidance to these institutions to mobilize more
              financing, and take on greater risk, in order to get more support to the Canadian businesses that need it.
              In addition to this overarching guidance, Budget&nbsp;2024 identifies specific new areas for these Crown
              corporations to focus on:
              <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Business Development Bank of Canada</strong> should increase financing for promising new
                  and high-growth businesses and accelerate reorientation of its venture capital investments toward
                  emerging and higher-risk sectors to help attract more private capital.</li>
                <li><strong>Export Development Canada</strong> should leverage its full toolkit and authorities,
                  including by updating internal risk management guidance to facilitate greater risk taking across its
                  portfolio. Recognizing that success for Canadian exporters in highly competitive markets and sectors
                  at times requires additional targeted support, Export Development Canada should also create a new
                  stretch capital envelope to maximize potential for exporters in areas of strategic importance for
                  Canada by taking on greater risk in deploying its capital. Having Export Development Canada take on
                  more higher-risk, higher-impact transactions itself will reduce the need for direct support through
                  the Canada Account. Further implementation details, including the scale and scope of the envelope,
                  will be identified over the coming months.</li>
                <li><strong>Farm Credit Canada</strong> should continue to pursue opportunities to support agri-food and
                  agribusiness, including through venture capital investment, and further deployment of technologies to
                  mitigate climate change. The government intends to amend the <em>Farm Credit Canada Act </em>to
                  require regular legislative reviews that ensure Farm Credit Canada's activities are aligned with the
                  sector's needs.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>In focusing their mandate on driving economic growth and productivity, these Crown corporations are also
          expected to prioritize new financing, insurance, and advisory support to under-financed business owners, as
          well as increase their public reporting and engagement with Canadians. The performance incentives of senior
          leaders are expected to align with their organizations taking on increased risk appetite in support of
          economic growth objectives. For Export Development Canada, performance incentives should also encourage
          alignment of business activities with countries that have free trade agreements with Canada. </p>
        <h3 id="a38">Investing in Canadian Start-Ups</h3>
        <p>Venture capital financing gives Canadian entrepreneurs the resources they need to start-up, scale-up, and
          become the next generation of Canadian anchor companies. Financing can help take new ideas from lab to market,
          while creating high-quality, middle-class jobs. </p>
        <p>The Venture Capital Catalyst Initiative (VCCI) strengthens Canada's venture capital ecosystem by co-investing
          with the private market, discovering and nurturing the next generation of globally recognized Canadian
          companies, and generating returns for private and public investors alike. Since&nbsp;2016, the government has
          invested $821&nbsp;million through VCCI, delivering support to over 300 companies across Canada. </p>

            <div class="media-body">Building on this momentum, Budget&nbsp;2024 proposes to provide $200&nbsp;million
              over two years, starting 2026-27, on a cash basis, to increase access to venture capital for
              equity-deserving entrepreneurs, and to invest in underserved communities and outside key metropolitan

        <h3 id="a39">Encouraging Pension Funds to Invest in Canada</h3>
        <p>Keeping Canada's vibrant economy strong for future generations of Canadians requires significant capital
          investments in our businesses, industries, and communities. Attracting higher levels of investment into Canada
          from all sources, including foreign and domestic private and institutional investors will raise Canada's
          productivity and increase living standards for all Canadians. </p>
        <p>Pension plans are a critical pillar in Canada's retirement income system that ensures Canadians can enjoy a
          secure and dignified retirement. Canadian pension funds hold over $3 trillion in assets, which are invested
          both at home and abroad to provide secure retirement income for plan members and retirees. </p>
        <p>The government believes that encouraging pension funds to invest in Canada more would help grow the Canadian
          economy and provide the stable long-term returns needed to deliver strong pensions for Canadians. In the
          <em>2023 Fall Economic Statement</em>, the government committed to improving transparency around pension
          funds' investments and to working collaboratively with Canadian pension funds to create an environment that
          encourages and identifies more domestic investment opportunities for pension funds and other responsible
          institutional investors.</p>
        <p>Canadian pension funds rely on their strong governance practices and diversified portfolios to deliver
          Canadians' pensions, with assets including public and private equity, infrastructure, real estate, and bonds.
          Canada's own economy is full of investment opportunities in these asset classes that could provide valuable
          contributions to pension fund portfolios. Opening up more opportunities for investment by pension funds in
          these domestic assets would help one of Canada's largest pools of savings contribute to the growth of the
          Canadian economy. </p>
        <p>Further engagement with industry experts and pension funds will guide the government's way forward on ways to
          make more domestic investments available that meet the needs of pension funds.</p>

              Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, to explore how to catalyze greater domestic investment
              opportunities for Canadian pension funds. This working group will identify priority investment
              opportunities that will grow Canadians' pension savings – that meet Canadian pension plans' fiduciary and
              actuarial responsibility, spur innovation, and drive economic growth. Its efforts will focus&nbsp;on
              areas, such as:
              <ul>
                <li>digital infrastructure and AI investment;</li>
                <li>physical infrastructure;</li>

          Economic Growth through Innovation program, businesses can access funding to scale-up, implement new
          technologies, improve productivity, and find new markets, helping to develop prosperous and inclusive
          communities across the country. </p>

        <h3 id="a41">Cutting Red Tape to Boost Innovation</h3>
        <p>For innovative businesses to scale-up new ideas, they need certainty that they will be able to bring their
          product to market. But existing regulation can often be too outdated to fit the needs of new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>To ensure regulation keeps pace with the speed of new innovations, rather than hold innovation back, the
          government is advancing work on regulatory "sandboxes" to create temporary rules to enable testing of
          products, services, or new regulatory approaches. </p>

            <p>Investments since Budget&nbsp;2017 in skills training measures include: </p>
            <p><strong>Labour Market Transfer Agreements:</strong> Annual investment of nearly $3&nbsp;billion enabling
              provinces and territories to deliver training and employment supports tailored to their unique labour
              market needs. </p>
            <p><strong>Union-based training:</strong> Over $200&nbsp;million through Budget&nbsp;2022 and Fall Economic
              Statement 2022 to expand the Union Training and Innovation Program to train more than 30,000 additional
              apprentices and journeypersons. </p>
            <p><strong>Employer-led training:</strong> Budget&nbsp;2021 announced the Sectoral Workforce Solutions
              Program to help key sectors of the economy, including the construction sector, implement solutions to
              address their current and emerging workforce needs. Budget&nbsp;2021 also announced $250&nbsp;million for
              the Upskilling for Industry Initiative to support more than 15,000 workers. Budget&nbsp;2024 proposes
              $50&nbsp;million over four years to provide skills training for workers in sectors disrupted by AI, and
              $10&nbsp;million over two years to train more early childhood educators, building up the talent needed for
              the expansion of affordable, high-quality child care.</p>
            <p><strong>Apprenticeship Service:</strong> Launched the Apprenticeship Service to help first year
              apprentices in construction and manufacturing Red Seal trades connect with opportunities at small and
              medium-sized employers. Budget&nbsp;2024 proposes to provide $90&nbsp;million over two years for the
              Apprenticeship Service to help create placements in the residential construction sector.</p>
            <p><strong>Skilled Trades Awareness and Readiness Program:</strong>&nbsp; Budget&nbsp;2018 announced the
              Skilled Trades Awareness and Readiness Program to help Canadians explore the trades and make informed
              career choices. Budget 2024 proposes $10&nbsp;million over two years to continue to encourage Canadians to
              explore and prepare for careers in the skilled trades. </p>
            <p><strong>Sustainable Jobs Training Fund:</strong>&nbsp; Recently launched the Sustainable Jobs Training
              Fund to help workers upgrade or gain new skills for jobs in the low-carbon economy.</p>
            <p><strong>Indigenous-led training:</strong> $99.4&nbsp;million per year through the co-developed Indigenous
              Skills and Employment Training (ISET) Program to help Indigenous people improve their skills and find
              employment.</p>
            <p><strong>Financial support for adult learners:</strong> About $250&nbsp;million per year for the Canada
              Training Credit, which covers up to&nbsp;50&nbsp;per cent of eligible training fees. </p>
            <p><strong>Affordability for Apprentices:</strong> Eliminated Elimination of interest on Canada Apprentice
              Loans, which provides up to $4,000&nbsp;per period of technical training for tuition, tools, equipment,
              living expenses and forgone wages.</p>
            <p><strong>Apprenticeship Requirements for Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits:</strong> to access the
              highest tax credit rates, projects must dedicate at least 10&nbsp;per cent of labour hours performed by
              covered workers to apprentices. This provides apprentices with the crucial hours they need to complete
              their training.</p>

        <h3 id="a49">Establishing a Right to Disconnect</h3>
        <p>Everyone needs some downtime; it is essential for well-being and mental health. As the nature of work in many
          industries has become increasingly digital, workers are finding it increasingly difficult to disconnect from
          their devices and inboxes after hours and on weekends. This has particularly impacted Millennial and Gen Z
          workers, many of whom have worked their whole careers without firm separation between work and personal
          time.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The government is taking action to restore work-life balance for the many workers in federally regulated
          industries, including but not limited to financial services, telecommunications, and transportation, by moving
          forward with a right disconnect from work, outside of their working hours.</p>
        <ul class="media-list lst-spcd mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">
          <li class="media">
            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-circle-arrow-right media-object pull-left mrgn-tp-sm"></span>
            <div class="media-body">Budget&nbsp;2024 proposes to provide $3.6&nbsp;million over five years, starting
              in&nbsp;2024-25, and $0.6&nbsp;million ongoing to enable the Labour Program at Employment and Social
              Development Canada to implement legislative amendments to the <em>Canada Labour Code</em> that would
              require employers in federally regulated sectors to establish a right to disconnect policy limiting
              work-related communication outside of scheduled working hours.
              <ul>
                <li>This is expected to benefit up to&nbsp;500,000 employees in federally regulated sectors.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Further, on the topic of worker misclassification, Employment and Social Development Canada and the Canada
          Revenue Agency will enter into necessary data-sharing agreements to facilitate inspections and enforcement.
        </p>
        <h3 id="a50">Modernizing the <em>Employment Equity Act</em></h3>
        <p>Through the <em>Employment Equity Act</em>, the government promotes and improves equality and diversity in
          federally regulated workplaces. Since the introduction of the <em>Employment Equity Act</em>, continued
          progress has been made to address inequalities, but some workers are still facing barriers to employment and
          many federal workplaces fail to reflect the full diversity of Canada's population. That is why, in&nbsp;2021,
          the government launched an arm's length Task Force to review the Act and advise on how to modernize the
          federal employment equity framework.</p>
        <ul class="media-list lst-spcd mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">
          <li class="media">
            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-circle-arrow-right media-object pull-left mrgn-tp-sm"></span>
            <div class="media-body">Following the recommendations of the Task Force, Budget&nbsp;2024 announces the
              government's intention to propose legislative amendments to modernize the <em>Employment Equity Act</em>,
              including by expanding designated equity groups.</div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="a51">Examining Critical Port Operations</h3>
        <p>Labour disputes and work stoppages at Canadian ports can lead to serious economic impacts by disrupting
          supply chains. To protect port workers and resolve the structural issues underlying port labour disputes,
          in&nbsp;2023, the government launched the first phase of a formal review in collaboration with industrial
          relations experts. </p>

              in&nbsp;2024-25, to enable the Labour Program at Employment and Social Development Canada to complete the
              second phase of its review, which will explore long-term solutions to minimize labour disputes, respect
              the collective bargaining process, and secure the stability of Canada's supply chains. This funding would
              be sourced from existing departmental resources.</div>

        </ul>

        <h3 id="a52">Extending Temporary Support for Seasonal Workers</h3>
        <p>Many seasonal workers—including in fishing and tourism sectors in Atlantic Canada and Quebec—rely on
          Employment Insurance for the support they need between work seasons. To address gaps in Employment Insurance
          support between seasons, the government introduced temporary rules in&nbsp;2018 to provide up to five
          additional weeks—for a maximum of&nbsp;45 weeks—to eligible seasonal workers in 13 economic regions. This
          support is set to expire in October&nbsp;2024.</p>

              regions until October&nbsp;2026. The cost of this measure is estimated at $263.5&nbsp;million over four
              years, starting in&nbsp;2024-25.&nbsp;</div>
